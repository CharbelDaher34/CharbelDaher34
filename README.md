HiðŸ‘‹

My name is Charbel Daher, i am currently a 3rd year electrical engineer student at the Lebanese University branch2 Roumieh.

I am interested in Artificial Intelligence and coding, which i will fully go for it after finishing my major.
Coursera specializations were parts of my learning process besides my university, i took some related to Ai and data science, and soon i will start doing some side projects to start building my portfolio
